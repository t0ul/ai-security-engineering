// Non-human identity (NHI) and capability-based authorization (C4a).
//
// Every actor in the agent that is not a human — the agent itself, each tool,
// each MCP server, the RAG reader — is a non-human identity: a named Subject
// that must present a signed, scoped, short-lived Grant to do anything with a
// side effect. This is the least-privilege spine the API authZ layer (C4b), the
// kill-switch-as-revocation demo (C4c), the read-only RAG path (C4d), and the
// scoped MCP tokens (C4e) all build on.
//
// A Grant is a Capability (who may do what, to which resource, in which tenant,
// until when) plus a detached ed25519 signature over its canonical bytes. It
// reuses the agent's existing provenance Signer/Verifier, so an NHI credential
// and an .ics content credential share one trust root — no new key management.
// A Grant is a bearer token: hold it and you may act within its scope until it
// expires or is revoked. Scopes never widen at use; a narrower request is
// covered by a broader grant, never the reverse (no confused deputy).
//
// Fail-closed throughout: an unsigned, tampered, expired, out-of-scope, or
// revoked Grant authorizes nothing, and engaging the kill switch (Halted)
// revokes every Grant at once — the containment primitive behind the kill-switch
// demo.
//
// Data-residency-aware scoping (the paradigm). A capability is scoped on three
// axes, not one:
//
//   - Action granularity. ActionRead (one named item you were told about) is not
//     ActionList (enumerate the whole set — the *harvest* primitive) is not
//     ActionExport (egress off the identity's boundary). Exfiltration needs
//     enumerate + export; those stay privileged apart from read, so a grant that
//     lets the agent read one contact never lets it harvest the address book.
//   - Resource classification (public / internal / confidential-PII), carried by
//     the caller's policy, not by this token.
//   - Consumer trust tier: where the Subject's *bound model* runs — on-host-local
//     (data never leaves the Mac) vs off-host-frontier (data ships to a third
//     party). The same read scope that is safe for a local model is an exfil
//     vector for a frontier one.
//
// The rule lives at issuance (IssuePolicy), not in the bearer token: a grant is
// mintable only if the consumer tier is cleared for the resource classification.
// A frontier-bound Subject is denied any confidential resource and any
// ActionList/ActionExport over one; it may receive only public or
// goflage-scrubbed (declassified) data. Because of this, swapping a Subject's
// model binding local->frontier (a governed model-swap, C5) is a
// grant-invalidating event: the swap must Revoke the Subject so no outstanding
// grant silently starts leaking. You cannot raise data egress by editing a model
// binding.
