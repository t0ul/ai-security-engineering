// Package skills is the agent's on-demand capability library (the "skills"
// dimension of the agent factory). A skill is a NAMED, VERSIONED, loaded-on-demand
// procedure — instructions (± scripts/resources) an agent pulls into context when a
// task needs it, to keep the always-on prompt lean.
//
// That makes a skill the sharpest supply-chain surface in an agentic system: it is
// runtime-loaded instructions/code from a possibly-untrusted source. A poisoned
// skill is persistent prompt injection (LLM03); a skill that reaches for a tool the
// agent was never granted is a confused deputy. So loading is fail-closed and
// layered, exactly like the .ics/M20 and MCP-pin controls this repo already runs:
//
//  1. SIGN   — the skill's content must carry a valid signature from a trusted key.
//  2. PIN    — its content hash must match the operator-approved pin (approve this
//              exact version; a changed skill is refused until re-approved — rug-pull).
//  3. SCOPE  — every tool the skill requires must be in the agent's allow-set
//              (a skill can only use tools the agent itself may use).
//
// Only when all three hold are the skill's instructions returned (trusted). The
// unchecked path (LoadUnsafe) exists ONLY as the undefended target of the ADD pair
// that proves why the control is here.
