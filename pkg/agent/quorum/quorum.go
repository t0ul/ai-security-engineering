// Package quorum defends against a rogue or colluding agent authorizing a
// sensitive action alone. An action is approved only when at least Threshold
// DISTINCT trusted agents have each signed that exact action (a2a signatures).
// A single compromised agent cannot reach the threshold, cannot forge a peer's
// signature, and cannot be counted twice — the inter-agent analogue of
// four-eyes.
