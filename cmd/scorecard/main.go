// Command scorecard is the M12 full-chain security gate, now powered by the ADD
// framework (github.com/t0ul/ADD). It evaluates every red-team technique's ADD
// invariant — the attack breaches the undefended baseline and the control blocks
// it — printing the attack-success-rate before and after each defense, plus the
// OWASP coverage grid. It exits non-zero if any invariant is violated, so it
// doubles as a CI security-regression gate: a real incident becomes a permanent
// check that cannot silently recur.
